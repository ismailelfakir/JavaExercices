# Java Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Java exercises grouped in a single project.  
Each exercise has its own class, and you can run them by **uncommenting** the corresponding section in the `Main.java` file.

- `Calculator.java`
- `Student.java`
- `EvenOddChecker.java`

The `Main.java` file is used to run them.

1. Open `Main.java`
2. Uncomment the code block for the exercise you want to test
3. Run the program
